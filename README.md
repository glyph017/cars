## Cars.sh

This program presents choices to the user using a while loop.
The user will be prompted to:
1. Type 1 to enter a new car.
  - If the user chooses to enter a new car, they will be asked separately for the car's year, make, and model.
  - These values will be combined into a string separated by colons and appended to the My_old_cars file.
2. Type 2 to display the list of cars.
  - This will display the lines of My_old_cars sorted by year.
3. Type 3 to quit and exit the program.
  - This will display a farewell message and exit the while loop.
